 *   the real (unsafe) eval function, so it acts as a 'direct eval' and can
 *    access its lexical scope (which maps to the 'with' binding, which the
 *   ScopeHandler also controls).
 * - ensure that all subsequent uses of 'eval' map to the safeEvaluator,
 *   which lives as the 'eval' property of the safeGlobal.
 * - route all other property lookups at the safeGlobal.
 * - hide the unsafeGlobal which lives on the scope chain above the 'with'.
 * - ensure the Proxy invariants despite some global properties being frozen.
